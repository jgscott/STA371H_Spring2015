title: Week 5 (February 16-18, 2015)
---


On Monday, we will discuss several important concepts regarding uncertainty quantification motivated by the last homework:  
* the analysis of variance  
* sampling distribution  
* bootstrapping  
* confidence interval  


On Wednesday, we will discuss the role of normality assumptions in statistical model, which provide alternative way to quantify uncertainty about parameters and predictions.  Key concepts:  
* the normal distribution as an aggregation of nudges  
* the four assumptions of the normal linear regression model  
* parametric standard errors  
* prediction intervals under the normal linear regression model  


### R skills

We will look at the following R walkthroughs in class.  
* [newspaper circulation](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/r/newspaper/newspaper.html): using the normal linear regression model to quantify uncertainty about parameters and predictions.   


### Reading

Finish reading Chapter 5 of the course packet.  This includes new material on the normal linear regression model.  Don't worry too much about the derivation of the prediction interval on page 137.
 



### Exercises  
[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises04-STA371H.pdf) require you to fit practice fitting some basic multivariate models.  They also require you complete two new R walkthroughs and apply the ideas to new data sets.  The exercises are due on Monday, February 16.
