title: Week 12 (April 13-15, 2015)
---

On Monday we will finish up Bayes' rule, talk about probability distributions and their moments, and introduce decision trees.  Key ideas:
* Discrete random variables their probability distributions  
* Continuous random variables and the PDF/CDF  
* decision trees  

On Wednesday, we will talk about joint distributions and covariance.  This will lead us into a discussion of linear combinations of random variables as a probability model for portfolios of financial assets.
* Joint distributions of more than one quantity   
* covariance/correlation of multiple random variables  
* linear combinations of random variables  

If we have time on Wednesday, we will begin a discussion of utility.


### Reading and exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises08-STA371H.pdf) are about conditional probability, correlated random variables, and decision trees.  They are due on Monday, April 20, 2015.

For this week, please read the _Notes on Probability_ and _Notes on Random Variables_ from the Resources Tab of the website.

For next week, please read the _Notes on Utility_, also from the Resources Tab of the website.  Please also read professional poker player Phil Laak's take on the Kelly criterion:
