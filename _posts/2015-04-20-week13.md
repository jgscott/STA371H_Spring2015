On Monday we will go over the last two homework assignments.  The files with solutions can be found here:    
* [R script for HW 7]({{ site.baseurl }}/r/exercises07-STA371H_2015.R)  
* [Excel spreadsheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/stocksjointdist-solution.xlsx) for computing the necessary quantities in problem 2.  
* [Decision-tree problem]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/treesolution.pdf)  

We will then start our discussion of expected utility.

On Wednesday, we will continue with utility theory and learn to use the Monte Carlo method to simulate the outcomes of complicated decision problems.  Please download the accompanying R script here:

### Reading and exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises09-STA371H.pdf) are about utility and Monte Carlo simulation.  They are due on Monday, April 27, 2015.

For this week, please read the _Notes on Utility_, also from the Resources Tab of the website.  Please also read professional poker player Phil Laak's take on the Kelly criterion:
