On Monday we will go over the last two homework assignments.  The files with solutions can be found here:  
* [R script for HW 7]({{ site.baseurl }}/r/exercises07-STA371H_2015.R)
* [Decision-tree problem on HW 8]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/treesolution.pdf)

We will then start our discussion of expected utility.

On Wednesday, we will learn to use the Monte Carlo method to simulate the outcomes of complicated decision problems.

### Reading and exercises  

[The exercises this week]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/exercises09-STA371H.pdf) are about utility and Monte Carlo simulation.  They are due on Monday, April 27, 2015.
